```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r glimpse}
df_covid %>% glimpse()
df_inc_dirty %>% glimpse()

```

```{r}
df_inc <- df_inc_dirty %>% 
  rename("Type" = X) %>%
  pivot_longer(-"Type", names_to = "Month")


df_inc
```


```{r}
df_inc %>%
  filter(Type == "Personal income") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(Month, value))
```
