*Purpose*: Something about COVID-19.


*Notes*:
- I had trouble running the Case study in my browser. Note that the `who` dataset is loaded by the `tidyverse`. You can run the Case study locally if you need to!
- The case study uses `gather` instead of `pivot_longer`; feel free to use `pivot_longer` in place.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# knitr options
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r library}
library(tidyverse)

```



```{r load data}
url_counties <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/live/us-counties.csv"
filename_nyt <- "./data/nyt_counties.csv"

## Download the data locally
curl::curl_download(
        url_counties,
        destfile = filename_nyt
      )

## Loads the downloaded csv
df_covid <- read_csv(filename_nyt)
```
