  *Purpose*: Something about COVID-19.


*Notes*:
- I had trouble running the Case study in my browser. Note that the `who` dataset is loaded by the `tidyverse`. You can run the Case study locally if you need to!
- The case study uses `gather` instead of `pivot_longer`; feel free to use `pivot_longer` in place.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# knitr options
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r library}
library(tidyverse)

```
